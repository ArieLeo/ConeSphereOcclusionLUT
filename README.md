ConeSphereOcclusionLUT
=======

ConeSphereOcclusionLUT generates a cone sphere occlusion LUT to be used with TLoU style capsule AO shadows. For details see page 26 of ["Lighting Technology Of "The Last Of Us""](http://miciwan.com/SIGGRAPH2013/Lighting%20Technology%20of%20The%20Last%20Of%20Us.pdf) talk by Micha≈Ç Iwanicki . This slick technique was originally created for SPU, but it perfectly works with compute shaders.
