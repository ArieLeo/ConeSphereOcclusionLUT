ConeSphereOcclusionLUT
=======

ConeSphereOcclusionLUT generates a cone sphere occlusion LUT to be used with TLoU style capsule shadows. For details see page 26 of "Lighting Technology Of "The Last Of Us"" talk be Micha≈Ç Iwanicki (http://miciwan.com/SIGGRAPH2013/Lighting%20Technology%20of%20The%20Last%20Of%20Us.pdf). This slick technique was originally created for SPU, but it perfectly works with compute shaders.
